# Replication_1006

In this replication I use the data and code form Ejdemyr, Kramon, Robinson (2017): Segregation, Ethnic
Favoritism, and the Strategic Targeting of Local Public Goods.  

All of the code files have comments from the authors.  I denote my own personal comments with ## as to not confuse people or take credit for their work.
