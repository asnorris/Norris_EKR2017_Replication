# Replication_1006

In this replication I use the data and code form Ejdemyr, Kramon, Robinson (2017): Segregation, Ethnic
Favoritism, and the Strategic Targeting of Local Public Goods.  

The authors' code can be found in the Replication folder. All of the code files have comments from the authors.  I denote my own personal comments with ## as to not confuse people or take credit for their work.

  The folder includes:
  
    functions.R (all of the functions needed to create the output of the other files)
    
    styilized-seg.R (code to create Figure 1)
    
    electdist-main.R (code to create Table 1)
    
    electdist.csv
    
    elecdist_codebook.csv
    
    locality-main.R (code to create Table 2 and Figure 2)
    
    locality-panel.csv
    
    locality-panel_codebook.csv
    
    Folers "figures" and "tables" where the figures and tables created by the code will go.
    
    
My figures for the extension can be created by running the file extension.Rmd.  This file uses the code from locality-main.R but uses different dependent variables.

My replication paper can be created by running the above files and then running the final file: Norris_Ethnic_Favoritism_Public_Goods.Rmd
